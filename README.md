# Tomasulo-Simulator
The ‘Tomasulo Algorithm’ is a powerful hardware tool to eliminate RAW hazards while also executing instructions in an out-of-order manner, increasing CPUs’ throughput and efficiency. The main goal behind this project is to simulate this algorithm in code while making sure it performs the same way as intended.
